# Street_safe_final

## Inspiration
If you were walking down Wyoming St in Detroit, Michigan, or 1st St in Jackson, Tennessee, you have reason to be terrified. You have a 10% chance of falling prey to violent crimes such as armed robbery and rape. In the “Land of the Free”, people ought to be free to tread quiet streets at night without fearing for their lives.

How can we improve the safety of people on America’s most dangerous streets? How can we shorten response times when a violent crime occurs? How can we make people feel safe and supported while walking alone at night?

At StreetSafe, we are seeking answers to these questions. Thus, we have created a virtual buddy that accompanies people on late-night walks and mobilizes for help when signs of violent crime are detected.
